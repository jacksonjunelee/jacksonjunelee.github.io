        <p>I am a passionate, adaptable, and fast-learning developer with over 6 years experience,</p>

        <p>I have worked with startups, medium-size companies and large companies. My experience is wide and I use the experiences that I have learned to develop better software, better products, and develop systems that make development easier, faster and more manageable.</p>

        <p>Throughout my career as a developer, I put a strong emphasis on the maintainability, readability, and scalability of the product and always strive to make the system better. The companies I have worked with ranges in all sizes and I have made lasting results including replacing legacy systems, developed a design system, and formulated development standards for these companies. I have experience leading teams and collaborating with developers of all levels and backgrounds. My mentorship experiences include training new developers to pursue their passion for programming and mentor them to become full-fledged developers.</p>
 
<p>My skillsets include Javascript, React, Angular and HTML/CSS. Additionally, I have experience working with other technologies such as AWS, Jenkins, Oracle, Solr, Redis, ElasticSearch, and many more. I have worked closely with clients, UX/UI designers, and managers to maintain communication and collaboration.</p>
 
<p>My passion for programming is fueled by the creative freedom, finding solutions to major problems, and bringing new products into the world with minimal overhead. I enjoy learning and I continuously aspire to keep my skills relevant and up-to-date.</p>
